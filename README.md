# Weather Application in React Native
This Weather Application is a React Native application that utilizes your
current location to dynamically fetch and display weather information. Additionally you 
can input a location to see its weather and save favorite location to view 
their weather later. It showcases how to integrate the `expo-location` library for geolocation services and the fetch API for retrieving weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API.
